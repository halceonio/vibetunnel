# Terminal Session Optimization – Findings & Fixes (October 2025)

## Summary
- **Context**: Mixed-device viewers (desktop + mobile) were fighting over terminal size, and long-running sessions became sluggish once scrollback exceeded ~10 K lines.
- **Goal**: Make terminal rendering resilient across devices and keep UI responsive under heavy output.

## Findings
1. **Global resize ownership**
   - Every resize request hit `/api/sessions/:id/resize` without identifying the caller.
   - The backend simply applied the latest width/height, so a smaller client (e.g., iPhone) shrank the shared PTY for all viewers.

2. **Unlimited scrollback in browser & server**
   - Headless xterm.js instances used a 10 K scrollback, but the browser renderer still tried to paint the entire active buffer.
   - No UX cue warned users that earlier lines were clipped or how to fetch them, forcing full history into the DOM and slowing renders.

## Fixes
1. **Per-client resize mediation**
   - Added `clientInstanceId` (localStorage-backed) and included it with every resize request.
   - `PtyManager` now tracks active clients, prunes stale entries, and applies the max width/height with timestamp expiration.
   - Session metadata stores per-client prefs so users can hop between devices without losing ergonomics.

2. **Lazy history truncation**
   - Reduced terminal scrollback to 5 K lines on both server and client.
   - When output exceeds the limit, the terminal emits a banner explaining that older lines were hidden.
   - “Show Full Log” button loads the full text via `/api/sessions/:id/text`, with download support, keeping the live viewport light.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Add a settings toggle to lift the 5 K cap for users running short sessions.
- Track per-client preference for monospace font size in localStorage to pair with the new resize ownership.
- Consider streaming historical chunks progressively instead of providing the full log in one payload.
