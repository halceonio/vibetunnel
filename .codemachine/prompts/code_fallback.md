# Code Refinement Task

The previous code submission did not pass verification. You must fix the following issues and resubmit your work.

## Original Task Description

```json
{
  "task_id": "I1.T7",
  "iteration_id": "I1",
  "iteration_goal": "Establish project structure, development environment, core architectural documentation, and CI/CD foundation",
  "description": "Create docker-compose.yml with MinIO (S3-compatible storage), Redis (cache), and Keycloak (OIDC provider) for local development. Include setup scripts to initialize MinIO buckets and Keycloak realm/client.",
  "agent_type_hint": "SetupAgent",
  "inputs": "Section 2 (Technology Stack), Section 3.9 (Deployment View), project requirements",
  "target_files": [
    "deployment/docker-compose.yml",
    "deployment/minio-setup.sh",
    "deployment/keycloak-setup.sh"
  ],
  "input_files": [],
  "deliverables": "docker-compose.yml with 3 services: minio, redis, keycloak, MinIO configured with default credentials and health check, Redis configured with persistence enabled, Keycloak configured with realm `platforms`, client `nudrive`, Setup scripts create `nudrive-thumbs` bucket and configure CORS",
  "acceptance_criteria": "`docker-compose up` starts all services without errors, MinIO accessible at http://localhost:9000 with console at :9001, Redis accessible at localhost:6379, Keycloak accessible at http://localhost:8080 with realm `platforms`, Setup scripts are idempotent (can run multiple times safely), README.md updated with local dev setup instructions",
  "dependencies": [
    "I1.T1"
  ],
  "parallelizable": true,
  "done": false
}
```

## Issues Detected

* **CORS configuration not applied:** `deployment/minio-setup.sh` writes invalid JSON keys (`AllowedOrigin`, `AllowedMethod`, etc.) inside `apply_cors()`. MinIOâ€™s `mc cors set` expects the plural property names (`AllowedOrigins`, `AllowedMethods`, `AllowedHeaders`, `ExposeHeaders`). Because of this mismatch, the script fails to configure CORS on the `nudrive-thumbs` bucket, violating the acceptance criterion that the setup script must configure CORS.

---

## Best Approach to Fix

Update `deployment/minio-setup.sh` so that `apply_cors()` emits the correct JSON schema (`AllowedOrigins`, `AllowedMethods`, `AllowedHeaders`, `ExposeHeaders`). Keep the values as arrays, ensure `MaxAgeSeconds` remains numeric, and rerun `mc cors set` to confirm it succeeds (you can verify with `mc cors get`). This will make the script idempotently apply the required CORS policy to `nudrive-thumbs`.
